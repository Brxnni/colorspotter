# The Plan
## Lines
- Find right contrast value such that enough lines are found for the following steps to make sense
- Assign a thickness and angle every line
- Split lines into "thick" and "thin" ones
- Try to find thick lines that are parallel (i.e. have a similar angle)

## Circle
- Find pixes of the right color (+- tolerance of course), starting from the center of the image

## Final
- Find the lines closest to the purple circle -> two thick lines are 1cm apart
- Use those to calculate the real-world area of the circle
